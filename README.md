ðŸ’»Phase 2 of Port Scanning: Scanning vulnerabilities in target machine

Vulnerability Scanner and Educational Tool
==========================================

Introduction
------------

This program is an enhancement of a previous port scanner utility. With the addition of features that not only identify vulnerabilities but also aim to educate the users on the role and significance of ports in system security, this tool takes a step further in ensuring safer digital environments.

Features
--------

1. Vulnerability Scanning: Scan systems and domains to identify potential vulnerabilities, making it easier for users to patch and secure their systems.
2. Port Description: For every detected port, a detailed description is provided so that users can understand its typical use-case and significance.
3. Educational Insights: A focus on teaching penetration testing principles ensures users are not only informed of vulnerabilities but also educated on their implications and how to mitigate them.

Purpose
-------

The goal of this program is twofold:
1. Security: To help administrators, developers, and hobbyists identify potential weak points in their systems or domains, and take the necessary corrective actions.
2. Education: To assist newcomers in the cybersecurity realm by offering insights into the world of pen testing, helping them understand the importance of securing ports and services.


Installation
------------

(Guide users on how to install and set up your program.)

$ git clone git@github.com:bryanmax9/Vulnerability_Scanner_Python.git
